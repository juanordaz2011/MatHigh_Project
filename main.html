            <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

            <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was
            born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of
            mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics
            and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most
            prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and
            papers</em>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

            <p>He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's
            work, <cite>Introductio in analysin
            infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for
            well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote
            <cite>Lettres &#224 une princesse d'Allemagne</cite> (1768-1772), giving a clear
            non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the
            time.</p>

            <p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler.
            Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> and &#960, were introduced
            in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind
            a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals
            of mathematics.</p>

            <h1>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h1>

            <p>Euler's Equation</p>

            <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = <var>e <sup>(ix)</sup></var></p>

            <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis,
                    and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
                    the identity</p>

            <p><var>e</var>(<sup>&#960<var>i</var></sup>) + 1 = 0</p>

            <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &#960, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in
                a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers
                conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named
                Euler's Identity as the
                most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.</p>
